Job searching API based on Symfony 6.1 PHP
------------------------------------------

Database Sqlite 3:
var/data.db for REST API
var/data_test.db for PHPUnit

API calls:

- new
- update
- delete 
- search


How to call these explained in Controllers Search and Position Controllers
this is available as well in Docs folder.
All invalid API calls return with 404 error page in production mode only
in developer mode return with exception and trace information.

Docs:
In docs folder, generated by PHPDoc.
you can generate API calls doc with PHPdoc.
to run phpdoc install it first into your computer and use ./j in project root folder
Documentation is not 100% just give your an impression how I usually document the code.

Logs:
You can find log in log folder. 
All API calls have received parameters, response debug level information. 
All exceptions and errors have log entries. 
Every custom log entry made by You hold the function and filename with line number where
the event did happen. 

Tests:
run ./t in project root folder

Run built-in PHP server:

run ./s in project root folder


To generate data for manual tests thru webserver:
run php bin/console data-gen
This generates data in REST API db var/data.db
For unit tests copy data.db to data_test.db
